# Tanks N Switches
![Tanks And Switches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielKilgallon/danielkilgallon.github.io/master/images/fulls/TanksNSwitches.png)

A simple puzzle game made in a week. Find the four switches in each level to advance!

See the [itch.io page](https://slick-revolver.itch.io/tanks-n-switches) to play it in browser.

This project is my first game ever made, there are many bugs, but this one is mine.

## Movement hint
Moving up a ramp and then switching directions and jumping at the same time gives you more height!
